## <u> Project #3 - Pig (Dice Game)</u>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)

<p> In this 2 player game, each user take a turn rolling the dice trying to reach a score of 100. Their current score is only logged when they click the hold button. If they roll a 1 before they click hold, their current score is reset to 0.
If they decide to save their score and click hold, or roll a 1, the 2nd player's turn is initiated.</p>
